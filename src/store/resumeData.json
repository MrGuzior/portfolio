This project was really exciting for our group since we were only two people so we had to learn to manage the time we had."

In early 2020 when I got the news that I got into <salt/> I knew that for a long time now I would mostly be working in javascript. That's why I spent one-week learning the basics of c#. After a week not only did I have a pretty decent and simple game to play but also... I fell in love with c#. I really enjoyed object-oriented programming and I'm sure I will come back to it one day."

I had no idea what I was doing back then but hey, it worked! Even though this is a very simple game I'm still proud of it and play it from time to time. Maybe one day I will make a better version of it? This game is a very simple cross country gliding simulator; gather height under clouds, fly towards turn point on the right and try to get back home. Hope you enjoy it!"
